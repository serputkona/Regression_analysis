# Regression Analysis

This repository focuses on regression analysis and includes the following components:

## Scatterplots

- **Visualization**: Creates scatterplots for two (three) related data arrays to determine the functional relationship between them.

## Regression Model

- **Model Building**: Constructs and fits a regression model based on the scatterplots to analyze the relationship between variables.

## Regression Line Visualization

- **Overlay**: Visualizes the regression line overlaid on the scatterplot to show the fitted model.

## Response vs. Prediction Plot

- **Plot Construction**: Shows response values against predicted values to assess the model's performance.

## Response vs. Residuals Plot

- **Plot Creation**: Displays response values versus residuals to evaluate model assumptions and identify patterns.

## Residuals by Observation Number

- **Plotting**: Plots residuals against observation numbers to detect any patterns or anomalies in residuals.

## Q-Q Plot for Residuals

- **Generation and Analysis**: Generates and analyzes the Q-Q plot for residuals to check the normality of residuals.

## Model Quality Evaluation

- **Assessment**: Assesses the modelâ€™s quality through both numerical metrics and graphical results to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Model Refinement

- **Improvement**: Refines the model based on identified deficiencies and re-evaluates its quality to enhance performance.
