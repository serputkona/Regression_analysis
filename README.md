This repository focuses on regression analysis and includes:
1. Scatterplots: Created for two (or three) related data arrays to determine the functional relationship.
2. Regression Model: Built and fitted based on the scatterplots.
3. Regression Line Visualization: Overlaid the regression line on the scatterplot.
4. Response vs. Prediction Plot: Constructed to show response versus predicted values.
5. Response vs. Residuals Plot: Created to display response versus residuals.
6. Residuals by Observation Number: Plotted residuals against observation numbers.
7. Q-Q Plot for Residuals: Generated and analyzed the Q-Q plot for residuals.
8. Model Quality Evaluation: Assessed the modelâ€™s quality through numerical and graphical results.
9. Model Refinement: Improved the model based on identified deficiencies and re-evaluated its quality.
